                <li>3 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
                <li>½ cup chopped pecans</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To prepare the sweet potatoes: Put sweet potatoes in a medium saucepan and cover with water. Cook over medium-high heat until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Mash drained sweet potatoes with a fork. Add eggs; mix until well combined. Add sugar, milk, butter, vanilla, and salt; mix until smooth. Transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>To make the topping: Mix brown sugar and flour together in a medium bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry cutter until mixture is coarse and looks like peas; don't overmix. Stir in pecans. Sprinkle topping over sweet potato mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is lightly browned, about 30 minutes.</li>
